I focus on Microsoft 365 identity and security: Entra ID, Conditional Access, Intune, and Purview.

Over the past 18 months I have completed 25+ fully documented labs that simulate real-world scenarios around access control, device compliance, and data protection. Each lab includes configuration steps, validation procedures, and evidence screenshots.

After 9 years in a high-pressure, customer-facing role at Whole Foods, I am transitioning into roles such as Identity and Access Management Analyst, Microsoft 365 Administrator, and Cloud Security Support. My goal is to bring a documentation-first mindset, strong communication skills, and hands-on technical experience into a production environment.

## ⭐ Featured Lab Series

If you are short on time, start here:

### 1. Risk-Based Conditional Access and Identity Protection

Enforced MFA only for high-risk sign-ins using Entra ID Identity Protection and Conditional Access, reducing friction for trusted users while blocking compromised accounts.

📁 [View Lab](https://github.com/miadco/Entra-Administration) | 🕒 About 15 minutes to skim

---

### 2. Intune Device Compliance Integrated with Conditional Access

Built Intune device compliance policies that require encryption, PIN, and an up-to-date operating system. Integrated those policies with Conditional Access to block non-compliant devices from accessing corporate data.

---

### 3. Microsoft 365 Support Escalation Lab

Simulated Tier 1 and Tier 2 support for Microsoft 365, including user access issues, mail flow problems, OneDrive and SharePoint access, and audit log review. Documentation is written the way I would hand off a case to another analyst.

## 🧪 How I Structure My Labs

Most labs follow a consistent structure to mirror production change documentation:

1. **Scenario and Problem Statement**  
   Example: “Require MFA only for high-risk sign-ins while limiting prompts for low-risk users.”

2. **Controls Implemented**  
   Conditional Access, Intune compliance, Purview DLP, or a combination of these.

3. **Configuration Steps**  
   Tenant-level and object-level changes documented in Markdown, including portal steps and PowerShell commands where needed.

4. **Validation and Testing**  
   Use of test accounts, device state changes, simulated risky sign-ins, or data exfiltration attempts to verify behavior.

5. **Evidence and Screenshots**  
   Portal views, policy hits, alerts, logs, and reports captured for each scenario.

6. **What I Learned and Next Steps**  
   Notes on behavior, edge cases, and how I would adjust the configuration in a real environment.

## 🧭 Why I Do This

I started this journey five years ago by learning HTML on Codecademy. My biggest mistake early on was treating tech like a hobby, but I quickly realized that growth does not come from shortcuts. I had to confront procrastination, fear of failure, indecision, and feelings of inadequacy head-on to learn that true progress in this field only comes from focus and dedication.

I have stayed committed through COVID, a full-time job, and every obstacle life has thrown my way. I have explored different areas of tech and found that identity, access, and governance are where I belong. This work combines my love for command-line precision with tools like PowerShell and Microsoft Entra ID, and the kind of structured thinking required to design and secure complex environments.

Every lab I build, every script I write, and every cert I earn is part of my mission to grow and contribute with clarity and integrity. My goal is to support organizations that take security seriously and to keep earning trust as I level up in the field. Identity, access, and governance are not just technical concepts to me. They represent trust, security, and accountability in modern systems.

I am not just looking for a job. I am ready to be an asset on day one.
