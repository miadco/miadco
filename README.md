**Cloud-Ready IAM + Support Analyst**  
Real-World Microsoft 365 + Identity Labs | GRC-Aware & Automation-Inclined

I'm pivoting into the world of Identity & Access Management, Cloud Support, and GRC with hands-on technical labs and enterprise simulations designed to solve real business problems — not just pass exams. My work bridges Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365, and Purview compliance tools with automation and structured documentation.
