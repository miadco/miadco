## 🧭 Why I Do This

I started this journey five years ago by learning HTML on Codecademy. My biggest mistake early on was treating tech like a hobby, but I quickly realized that growth doesn’t come from shortcuts. I had to confront procrastination, fear of failure, indecision, and feelings of inadequacy head-on to learn that true progress in this field only comes from focus and dedication.

I've stayed committed through COVID, a full-time job, and every obstacle life has thrown my way. I’ve explored different areas of tech and found that identity, access, and governance are where I belong. This work combines my love for command-line precision with tools like PowerShell and Microsoft Entra ID, and the kind of structured thinking required to design and secure complex environments.

Every lab I build, every script I write, and every cert I earn is part of my mission to grow and contribute with clarity and integrity. My goal is to support organizations that take security seriously and to keep earning trust as I level up in the field. Identity, access, and governance aren’t just technical concepts to me. They represent trust, security, and accountability in modern systems.

I’m not just looking for a job. I’m ready to be an asset on day one.
